# hypercraft
ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§ hypercraft is a VMM library written in Rust. If you are interested in Design & Implement about this project, please see this [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/rcore-os/discussions/13). Currently, hypercraft relies heavily on the arceos crate, reusing multiple crates and modules from arceos for development.

## Build & Run
```
# create workspace
mkdir $(WORKSPACE)
cd $(WORKSPACE)

# clone project
git clone https://github.com/rcore-os/arceos.git
git clone https://github.com/KuangjuX/hypercraft.git

# build & run
cd hypercraft
make qemu
```

## RoadMap
- CPU Virtualization
    - [x] Vcpu abstract layer(`vcpu_create()`, `vcpu_read()`, `vcpu_write()`, `vcpu_run()`)
    - [x] Load & run hello world binary in example.
    - [x] `PerCpu` struct Design to support SMP
    - [ ] Multi-Guest switch support(vcpu schedule)
- Memory Virtualization
    - [ ] `GuestMemorySet` Design
    - [ ] Multi-level Page Table Supportd
- I/O Virtualization
    - [ ] Device Passthrought Supportd
    - [ ] IOMMU Support
    - [ ] Device Emulate
- Interrupt Virtualization
    - [ ] PLIC Emulate && Interrupt Inject
    - [ ] AIA Supported

Zircon is composed of a kernel (source in /zircon/kernel) as well as a small set of userspace services, drivers, and libraries (source in /zircon/system/) necessary for the system to boot, talk to hardware, load userspace processes and run them, etc. Fuchsia builds a much larger OS on top of this foundation.
